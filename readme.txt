Control the editions of your magazine or just group up the content of your blog. Easy and with no expensive software.

== Description ==

Magazine edition control is a Wordpress addin that controls your magazine editions or just simply groups up your content.

You can add:

1. The title of the edition you published
2. A description of the edition
3. Links to any content on your Wordpress installation

Over time you have an extended index of all your published magazine editions on your website with no requirement of expensive software.

== Installation ==

**The private part of the installation.**

1. Upload the magazine-edition-control folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. Be sure its named magazine-edition-control
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Place `<?php echo magazineditions_picturebook() ?>` in your template.

Use the magazineditions_picturebook() API in your templates to display a list of images. It will create a list of images set by your "URL of edition front" settings which points to the editions page.

**The public part of the installation.**

The public part of the installation is easy, just insert the [magazine-edition-control] shortcode in a page (or a post if you really want to).
